GloboNetworkAPI Web UI 
======================

This web tool helps network administrator manage and automate networking
resources (routers, switches and load balancers) and document logical and
physical networking.

It lays on top of
[GloboNetworkAPI](https://github.com/globocom/GloboNetworkAPI/), so you need
it installed and acessible in order to use the WebUI.
They were created to be vendor agnostic and to support different orquestrators

allocated.
